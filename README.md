# Educathon (Hackathon Tor Vergata 2017 Project)

Educathon is a simple knowledge base API. You pass questions with natural language and it will do its best to find you an answer/explanation. You can contact it via web, Messenger or Telegram.

The backend runs on Sinatra. The Messenger bot is implemented in Ruby, while the Telegram one is Node.js. 

We won first place at the competition!
